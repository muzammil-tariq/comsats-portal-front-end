# FYP FRONTEND

## How to set up the project?

- git clone git@github.com:loralridz/FYP-FE.git
- npm i
- create .env file in project folder
- paste the following in .env file
  REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000

- start the app by running
  - npm run start

## Some Conventions to follow

- Always checkout/create a new branch from dev
- pull dev branch before pushing code
- remove unused code
- test the code before push
- create a pull request(pr) with dev branch and add reviewers to check the code or to merge

- This is a bad idea
